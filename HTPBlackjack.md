# How To Play: Blackjack
Blackjack is a chance-based card game using all 52 cards excluding the Joker. 

### Objective
To win against the dealer in blackjack, you have to get as close as you can to 21 without going over. This is determined by the value of the cards you are dealt and the ones you happen to draw.

### Card Values
2-10: Value reflected by the displayed number.
J-Q-K: Face cards are all worth 10.
A: The Ace is either worth 1 or 11, depending on if you exceed 21 with the cards you already have. The code already accounts for this possibility, and converts the value of the Ace to 1 automatically once you surpass 21.
