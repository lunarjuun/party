# Årsoppgave Vår 2025 — Blackjack Web Game 🃏
### Dominic Aramis, 2IMB

A browser-based Blackjack game built using JavaScript, ran on a Python server.
My project was created with the goal of learning about server hosting, JavaScript, and databases using MariaDB.

## Target Audience
Since my project is a game, my target audience is people who are looking for something to pass the time. Reason simply being that I’m one of them. I enjoy card games, but I don’t always have a deck of cards available — so I’ve tried to solve that problem with this project; making it on the web instead of needing to download an app just to play.

## Accessibility/UU and UX
I’ve made sure that all text is easy to read and that the background has good contrast with the text. I also use fitting text sizes on both the landing page and the game page. I also did media queries for both sites.

## Legality
The images used for the card deck are open-source, but the dealer is my original character. I also drew the sprites.

## Languages Used
- HTML (Elements)
- CSS (Styling)
- Python (Hosting)
- Javascript (Functionality)
- MariaDB/SQL (Database)
